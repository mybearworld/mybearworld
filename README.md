### Hi, I'm mybearworld!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ***SCSS**, which seems like a great way to make CSS much more bearable.*
 - ðŸ“« How to reach me: ***Scratch** - I'm also [mybearworld](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/mybearworld) there.*
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ***they/them** - I don't mind any, I'd just prefer to keep my gender private.*
- âš¡ Fun fact: ***Did you know** that 85.776% of statistics are made up on the fly and/or overused jokes?*
